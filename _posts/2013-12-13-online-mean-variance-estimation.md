title : Online adaptive estimation of mean and variance
mathjax : true
---

Suppose we have a random variable $$x$$. Observations arrive in a stream, $$x_t$$ indicates the observation at time $$t$$. If we have access to all the historical observations, the mean is $$\bar{x}_t = \frac{1}{t}\sum_{i=1}^t x_i$$.

If we do not have access to all the historical data, the mean can be estimated online recursively. Using $$\bar{x}_{t-1} = \frac{1}{t-1}\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} x_i$$ we get
$$
\bar{x}_t = \frac{1}{t}\sum_{i=1}^t x_i = \frac{1}{t} \left(\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} x_i + x_t \right) = \frac{t-1}{t}\bar{x}_{t-1}+ \frac{1}{t} x_t.
$$
We need to keep in memory only the previous estimate $$\bar{x}_{t-1}$$ and the counter $$t$$. 

This recursive estimate does not have any forgetting mechanism. When $$t$$ gets large, the contribution of the next $$x_t$$ to the estimate becomes very small. In addition, it may happen that the distribution of data changes over time. Therefore, we may want to have an adaptive mean estimate $$\bar{x}_t^\star$$, which can be recursively computed using a simple exponential smoothing
$$
\bar{x}_t^\star = (1-\alpha)\bar{x}_{t-1}^\star + \alpha x_t,
$$ 
here $$\alpha \in (0,1)$$ is the smoothing weight. The larger $$\alpha$$, the faster the forgetting.


Similarly, we can estimate the variance $$\mathit{Var}(x)$$. If we have access to  all the historical data, sample variance is estimated as $$\mathit{Var}(x)_t = \frac{1}{t-1}\sum_{i=1}^t (x_i - \bar{x})^2$$, where $$\bar{x}$$ is the mean. 

Online recursive estimation is given by 
$$
\mathit{Var}(x)_t = \frac{1}{t-1}\sum_{i=1}^t (x_i - \bar{x})^2 = 
\frac{1}{t-1} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{t-1} (x_i - \bar{x})^2  + (x_t - \bar{x})^2 \right) = \frac{t-2}{t-1} \mathit{Var}(x)_{t-1} + \frac{1}{t-1} (x_t - \bar{x})^2.
$$

Adaptive online estimation is given by 
$$
\mathit{Var}(x)_t^\star = (1-\alpha)\mathit{Var}(x)_{t-1}^\star + \alpha (x_t - \bar{x})^2,
$$
where $$\alpha \in (0,1)$$ is the smoothing weight.
