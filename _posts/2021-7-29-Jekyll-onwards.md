My research blog runs on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for eight years now. I wanted something basic back then, plain vanilla as they say in finance, something that would not expire over the years. Something like TEX?

Now eight years later it still works. The math went out of tune, but I just fixed it as instructed [here](https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2018/08/05/mathjax-in-jekyll/).

Happy blogging!
