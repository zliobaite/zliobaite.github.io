title: Scaling of tooth wear rates
---

We get rejections all the time. I've had perhaps hundreds of them over the years, jobs, funding applications, research papers. But this one somehow got me off guard. This was a small scale study prepared over Christmas break and sent to a local journal. And it got unlistened to, hopelessly.

I made it available online as a technical report together with both reviews attached until I decide what's next. Welcome!
