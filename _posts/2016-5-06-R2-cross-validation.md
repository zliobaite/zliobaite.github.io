The coefficient of determination, denoted as $$R^2$$
, is commonly used in evaluating the performance of
predictive models, particularly in life sciences. It
indicates what proportion of variance in the target
variable is explained by model predictions. 

$$R^2$$ takes values between minus infinity and one, the higher – the better. 
If tested on the same data as the model was fitted, zero means that the performance is the same as naïve baseline always predicting a constant.

When using $$R^2$$ with leave-one-out cross-validation, we need to normalize the score as otherwise the naïve baseline is below zero (more details can be found in our [ArXiv note](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01703)). 
The normalization depends only on the number of data points in cross-validation, and is 

$$R^2* = \frac{R^2 – R^2_{\mathit{naive}}{1 – R^2_{\mathit{naive}}$$, 
where 

$$R^2_{\mathit{naive}} = 1 - \frac{n^2}{(n-1)^2}$$,

where $$n$$ is the number of data points.
