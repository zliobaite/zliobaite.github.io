A first version of
[*A survey on measuring indirect discrimination in machine learning*](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00148) is now posted to ArXiv. 

I will keep it in ArXiv for a while before preparing a journal submission. I'm looking for feeback or suggestions, which can be posted to comments at this blog post or to me via e-mail.
