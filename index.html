<h3>Welcome</h3>

<br>

My name is Indr&#279; &#381;liobait&#279;. I'm an interdisciplinary data explorer and a professor in computer science.
 More info about my research is on <a href="http://www.zliobaite.com">my research  website</a>.
Here I post bits and pieces that don't make it to academic papers, I write about unexpected discoveries and peculiar findings, as well as academic life.
