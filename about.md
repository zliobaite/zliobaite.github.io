My name is Indrė Žliobaitė. I'm an interdisciplinary data explorer and a professor in computer science. 
 More info about my research is on [my research group website](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/data-science-and-evolution) and [my personal website](http://www.zliobaite.com).
 
Here I post bits and pieces that don't make it to academic papers, I write about unexpected discoveries and peculiar findings, as well as academic life.
