<p>Privacy concerns in contemporary data analysis are loud. Anonymity is becoming one of the main principles of large scale machine learning systems today. Any patterns extracted from personal data are expected to satisfy differential privacy, any release of datasets should comply with k-anonymity. The principle is simple – any patterns extracted from data should stay valid if we remove any one individual from the dataset. The extracted patterns should be generic enough such that if we pick any relation or data point, we would be able to attribute it to a group of, say, three individuals, but we would not know who of those three did what. A community is responsible for each pattern.</p>

<p>Now, imagine a world of privacy preserving palaeontology. At first the concept seems insane – they are all dead for millions of years, why would anyone want to preserve privacy. And yet, what if patterns and relationships inferred from fossil data would have to be generic to an extent that it would not be possible to pinpoint any pattern to a smaller group than, say, thee species. The model would be aware that someone crossed The Bering Strait 12 million years ago, but would not know that it was a hipparion. It would capture that someone fell from a tree 3 million years ago, but would never guess that it was Lucy. It would know that somebody made and heavily used stone tools in Fuente Nueva around 1.4 million years ago, but would be blind to which species of <em>Homo</em> it was. Would palaeontology still be meaningful?</p>

<p>Our identify defines who we are and where we come from – our family name, our family tree, our phylogenetic tree. Anonymity will discard ancestral relationships. Only function will matter. Only a group of companions will be a unit of analysis, not an individual. Privacy. Diplomacy. Regards to the family.</p>
