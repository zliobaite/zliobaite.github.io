I"é<p>Modern forms of discrimination are subtile and difficult to spot, and, perhaps even not intentional. Indirect discrimination is such. Typically, it is a rule or a procedure that puts certain groups of people into a disadvantage. For example, a requirement to fill in a research grant application form in MS Excel puts into a disadvantage users of Linux or Mac OS. Software platform, of course, is not yet a legally recognised ground for discrimination, but it makes a good example.</p>
