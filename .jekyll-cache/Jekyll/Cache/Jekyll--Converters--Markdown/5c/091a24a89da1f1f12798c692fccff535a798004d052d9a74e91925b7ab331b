I"³<p>This is a follow up on the post on <a href="/evolution/2021/07/30/Human-evolution1.html">trends in human evolution research</a>, outlining how the analysis was done.

Iâ€™m sure most of the steps could be done more elegantly and efficiently with a bit more exploration, but my solution worked for the purpose (of exploration).</p>
