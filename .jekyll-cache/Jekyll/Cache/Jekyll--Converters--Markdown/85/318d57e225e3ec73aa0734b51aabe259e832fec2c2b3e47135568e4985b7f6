I"q<p>A first version of
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00148"><em>A survey on measuring indirect discrimination in machine learning</em></a> is now posted to ArXiv.</p>

<p>I will keep it in ArXiv for a while before preparing a journal submission. Iâ€™m looking for feedback or suggestions, which can be posted to comments at this blog post or to me via e-mail.</p>
