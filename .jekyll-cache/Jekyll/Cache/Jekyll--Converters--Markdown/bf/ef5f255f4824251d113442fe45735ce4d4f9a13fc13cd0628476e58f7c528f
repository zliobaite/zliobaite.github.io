I"¢<p>This is a follow up on the post on <a href="/evolution/2021/07/30/Human-evolution1.html">trends in human evolution research</a>, outlining how the analysis was done. This is not an elegant solution, I apologise. I wanted a quick prototype, thus I used a zoo of tools. Iâ€™m sure most of the steps could be done more elegantly and efficiently with a bit more exploration, but the solution works for the purpose.</p>
