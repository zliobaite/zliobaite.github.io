As a test case I did topic modeling and sentiment analysis on research articles published in the <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-human-evolution">Journal of Human Evolution</a> over the last 50 years. The analysis covered 4014 articles.</p>

<p>This post is about the results. I made <a href="/machine-learning/2021/08/02/Human-evolution2.html">a separate post</a> where I put technical instructions on how to do such analysis. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/zliobaite/text_mining_human_evolution">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="which-words">Which words?</h2>

<p>First I looked at the frequencies of words. Commonly, very frequent and very rate words are removed from text mining, since usually they are not informative. The words <em>human</em> and <em>evolution</em> would appear in every article simply because they are in the title of the journal. Articles and propositions are typically removed at an early stage as well, since they do not associate with textual content. Punctuation is also usually removed for similar reasons. Sometimes punctuation or articles can carry <a href="https://medium.com/@neuroecology/punctuation-in-novels-8f316d542ec4">interesting signals</a> on their own, but for this analysis I just <a href="/machine-learning/2021/08/02/Human-evolution2.html">removed them</a>.</p>

<p>For starters, I visualized the most frequent and the rarest words across all the articles, not quite, but close enough. I set the upper threshold for the words to occur at 99% of the articles, and the lower threshold at 1%. Here is what came up.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/frequent_words2.png" alt="Frequency threshold 0.01" /></p>

<p>From visual inspection, the cutoffs do not look good enough for analysis. The top words are too generic and too methodology oriented, like  <em>size</em>, <em>primate</em>, <em>type</em>, <em>study</em>, <em>analysis</em>. The bottom words are too outliery, like <em>humanosteology</em> (as one word), <em>concomitantly</em> or <em>ssxampdf</em>.</p>

<p>After some trials and visual inspections I settled for thresholds 0.5 and 0.05. This means that the words to be included in text mining can occur in at most 50% of the articles, and at least 5%. In total xx words remained, the most and the least frequent words were these.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/frequent_words4.png" alt="Frequency threshold 0.01" /></p>

<p>Itâ€™s still not ideal, for example, <em>jpg</em> and <em>jpeg</em> could be thought as irrelevant. But since they occur in less than half of the articles, they might as well be informative. For instance, they may be informative of topics that are visually intensive, such as those analyzing morphologies. Anyhow, one has to decide where to cut. One may also make a manual dictionary of words to be removed and go for higher thresholds overall. For this analysis settled with this setup.</p>

<h2 id="topics">Topics</h2>

<p>[Topic modeling] rose into popularity in early 2000s. It is a bit like clustering, but not quite. Most often topic modeling is used for analyzing textual data</p>
