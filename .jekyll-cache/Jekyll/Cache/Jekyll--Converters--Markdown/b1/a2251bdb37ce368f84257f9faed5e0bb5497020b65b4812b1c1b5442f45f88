I"ƒ<p>In February, while on winter holiday trip, I visited aurora researchers at <a href="http://www.unis.no/">The University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS)</a>. We talked about machine learning and stuff. They recently set up a colour camera at <a href="http://kho.unis.no/">Kjell Henriksen Observatory</a>, and are interested in detecting and recognising auroras from images in real time.</p>
