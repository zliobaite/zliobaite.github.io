<p>The coefficient of determination, denoted as \(R^2\)
, is commonly used in evaluating the performance of
predictive models, particularly in life sciences. It
indicates what proportion of variance in the target
variable is explained by model predictions.</p>

<p>\(R^2\) takes values between minus infinity and one, the higher â€“ the better. 
If tested on the same data as the model was fitted, zero means that the performance is the same as naÃ¯ve baseline always predicting a constant.</p>

<p>When using \(R^2\) with leave-one-out cross-validation, we need to normalize the score as otherwise the naÃ¯ve baseline is below zero (more details can be found in our <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01703">ArXiv note</a>). 
The normalization depends only on the number of data points in cross-validation, and is</p>

<p>\(R^2* = \frac{R^2 â€“ R^2_{\mathit{naive}}{1 â€“ R^2_{\mathit{naive}}\), 
where</p>

<p>\(R^2_{\mathit{naive}} = 1 - \frac{n^2}{(n-1)^2}\),</p>

<p>where \(n\) is the number of data points.</p>
