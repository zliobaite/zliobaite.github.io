I"¶<p><a href="https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/people/people-finder/tegan-foister-9421865">Tegan Foister</a> asked me one day if we could analyze human evolution via text mining. As a test case I did topic modeling and sentiment analysis on research articles published in the <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-human-evolution">Journal of Human Evolution</a> over the last 50 years.</p>

<p>This post is about the results. I made <a href="/machine-learning/2021/08/02/Human-evolution2.html">a separate post</a> where I put technical instructions on how to do such analysis. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/zliobaite/text_mining_human_evolution">GitHub</a>.</p>
