I"°<p>We have a new project, called <a href="https://cse.aalto.fi/research/groups/distributed-systems-group/projects/trafficsense/">TrafficSense</a>. One of the goals is to infer and predict movement patterns of people using mobile sensing for better efficiency in transportation.</p>

<p>But mobile sensing itself consumes energy. Iâ€™ve been looking how to calculate how much energy a mobile phone is consuming while collecting location and movement data.</p>

<p>The simplest way is as follows. The electric charge of a mobile phone battery $Q$ is given in mAh (milliampere-hour), Ah is a unit of electric charge (like flow in pipes). There is also voltage $V$ in V (volt). Volt is a unit of electrical potential (like pressure in pipes).</p>

<p>The electric charge Q(mAh) in milliampere-hours (mAh) is equal to the energy E(Wh) in watt-hours (Wh) times 1000 divided by the voltage V(V) in volts (V):
Energy $E$ in Wh (watt-hours) can be calculated as</p>

\[E_{(Wh)} = Q_{(mAh)} \times V_{(V)} / 1000.\]

<p>This gives approximately the energy consumed during one battery discharge from 100% to 0%.</p>

<p>A simplest way to calculate how much energy has been used in a certain time period is to look at the level of battery (in percentage) at the start and at the end of the period.</p>

<p>One can collect more exact data about battery discharge and voltage using, for instance, the Open Sensing Framework <a href="http://www.funf.org/">FUNF</a>.</p>
