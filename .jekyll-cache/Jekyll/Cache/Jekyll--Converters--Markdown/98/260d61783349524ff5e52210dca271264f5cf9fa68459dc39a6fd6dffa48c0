I"><p>A recent <a href="http://cad.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/09/26/0011128714549655.abstract">study</a> in criminology points out a major flaw in interpretation by previous studies, which have been suggesting that 50% of offenders released from state prisons return to prison within 3 to 5 years. The study points out that 2/3 of the prisoners actually never return. The figures are overstated due to sampling procedure. If a survey targets prisoners currently serving their sentence, it is biased towards returning prisoners, and not representative of all prisoners.</p>
