I"Õ<p>This is a follow up on the post on <a href="/evolution/2021/07/30/Human-evolution1.html">trends in human evolution research</a>. Iâ€™ll explain how the analysis was done technically. There will be a zoo of tools, simply because I wanted to do it fast and for each next step I chose the tools that were quickly at hand. Iâ€™m sure most of the steps could be done more elegantly and efficiently with a bit more exploration, but the solution works for the purpose.</p>
