title : Predicting rain from fossil teeth
---

It is possible. For about a year now I have been working with paleontologists, researchers who study fossils. We  model climate from animal teeth via transfer learning. Here is how it works.

Typically, the best preserved parts in fossils are teeth. Teeth also have very complex patterns, as compared to, for example, bones. And these patterns evolutionary depend on what kind of food animals have been eating. And food availability depends on the climate. So teeth can serve as currency for converting current climate conditions back to millions of years ago. 

Numerical features can be extracted from teeth, describing their functional traits. For example, length to width ratio, how many edges, direction of edges, their connectivity, and many more. 

For the present day world we can divide the world into squares, and describe distribution of dental traits for each square. We can them make predictive models to predict, say rain or temperature for each square. And then we apply those models on fossil data.  

Paleontologists have databases of fossils, they know where fossils were found, and they can tell their age. They can group fossils into areas of similar size to the squares in modern data. 
And they can score the teeth numerically. Of course, there are many challenges how to approximate distribution of dental traits for fossils, but the principle is cute. Teeth predict rain millions of years ago.
